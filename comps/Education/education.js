    text: "During my learning journey, I had to face various challenges with many ups and downs. One of the hardest tasks was learning Javascript after mastering the CSS and HTML. With time I started using Bootstrap for my projects and realized that I need more control over the elements I create so I switched to TailwindCSS, which allows me to create custom components at ease. React was essential to learn and I couldn't wait to experiment with it right on my first day of learning JS. With React my coding skills have reached the industry standards. After learning the basics of React I jumped right away to learning Next.js which is another library based on React that I love for its ability to optimize webpages. My learning journey never stops.",
